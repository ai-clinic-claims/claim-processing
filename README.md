Claims Processing with AI Fraud Detection Capabilities

Project Documentation – September 2025

Executive Summary

This project introduces an AI-driven automation solution to improve reinsurance claims processing.
The system scans emails and documents, extracts key claims data using OCR and AI, performs fraud detection and compliance checks, and integrates with the SICS platform for real-time claim settlement.
The goal is to reduce loss ratios, accelerate claims settlement and enhance customer satisfaction.

Background

Reinsurance claims processing currently relies heavily on manual labour—data entry, verification and validation—which is slow and prone to human error.
Fraudulent claims and delayed settlements increase costs and reduce customer confidence.

Objectives

* Enhance fraud detection in claims processing
* Improve efficiency and productivity
* Reduce loss ratios and grow revenue
* Streamline communication and collaboration
* Optimize resource allocation
* Deliver superior customer experience

Stakeholders

Customers/Insurance Companies – Benefit from faster claim settlements.
Policyholders – Experience quicker resolution and improved service.
Regulators – Gain improved transparency and compliance.
Management & Shareholders – Ensure strategic alignment and profitability.
Staff & Rating Agencies – Access accurate data and reporting.

Current vs Desired State

Current: Manual data entry and verification, time-consuming and error-prone, causing settlement delays.
Desired: Fully automated, AI-driven claims lifecycle with real-time processing, accurate fraud checks, and seamless reporting.

Constraints and Assumptions

Constraints:

* Integration with existing systems such as SICS PC & LIFE and Oracle EBS
* Data security and privacy requirements
* Variability in input file formats and inconsistent labeling
* Resistance to process change among staff

Assumptions:

* AI consumes data from cedant claim notifications, bordereaux, statements, and treaty slips.
* Files are shared via email or central repository.

System Architecture

1. Email/Repository Ingestion – Capture incoming claims notifications and attachments.
2. Document Processing – OCR scans documents and extracts text.
3. AI & Fraud Detection – Machine learning and LLM (e.g., Google Gemini) extract data fields, compare totals, check treaty exclusions, and identify suspicious patterns.
4. Supervisor Verification – Optional review if anomalies are detected.
5. Claims System Integration – Bot logs into SICS to create claims, generate credit notes, and update records.
6. Reporting & Alerts – Automatically generate reports and notify stakeholders.

Step-by-Step AI Bot Procedure

1. Scan emails for claim notification documents.
2. Detect and read cedant bordereaux and statements.
3. Filter and sum paid-loss columns by underwriting year.
4. Compare summed bordereaux paid losses with cedant statement totals; flag discrepancies.
5. Check exclusions clauses in treaty slips against bordereaux benefits.
6. Verify date of loss and payment period within policy limits.
7. Confirm insured’s age does not exceed limits.
8. Aggregate paid loss amounts using Parent-ID to stay within treaty limits.
9. Detect duplicates using claim numbers, dates, and broker/cedant references.
10. Request supervisor verification if all checks pass.
11. Post validated claims to SICS, generate credit notes, and distribute reports.

Technology Stack

RPA: UiPath or Automation Anywhere for repetitive tasks
AI/LLM: Google Gemini or equivalent for natural language data extraction
Machine Learning: Predictive analytics and anomaly detection for fraud
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Integration: SICS PC & LIFE, Oracle EBS
Reporting & Alerts: Streamlit/Power BI dashboards, automated email/Slack notifications

Benefits

Reduced Loss Ratios: By identifying fraudulent or non-compliant claims.
Faster Settlements: Real-time processing shortens the claims lifecycle.
Improved Customer Service: Quicker resolutions increase satisfaction.
Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual data entry and human error.
Better Resource Allocation: Staff can focus on high-value tasks.

Security & Compliance

* End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
* Role-based access control and audit logs
* Compliance with data-protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)

Conclusion

This AI automation solution transforms reinsurance claims processing by integrating OCR, machine learning, and fraud detection.
It enables accurate, efficient, and secure claims settlement, laying the foundation for end-to-end automation of reinsurance operations.
